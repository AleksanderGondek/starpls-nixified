# Starpls
`starpls` is a language server for [Starlark](https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark), the configuration language used by Bazel and Buck2.

## Acknowledgements
- `starpls` is heavily based on the [rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/tree/master) codebase; one might consider it a vastly simplified version of rust-analyzer that works on Starlark files! As such, major thanks to the rust-analyzer team, especially [Aleksey Kladov](https://matklad.github.io/), whose [Explaining rust-analyzer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhb66M_x9UmrqXhQuIpWC5VgTdrGxMx3y) series on YouTube proved invaluable as a learning resource!
